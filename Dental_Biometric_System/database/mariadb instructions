In the terminal, you can use the mysql command-line tool to interact with your MariaDB databases. Here are the basic steps to see your databases and then switch to and interact with a specific database:

    See Your Databases:

    bash

mysql -u your_username -p

Replace your_username with your actual MariaDB username. You'll be prompted to enter your password. After entering the password, you'll enter the MariaDB command-line interface.

List Databases:

sql

SHOW DATABASES;

This will display a list of databases. Look for your desired database, such as forensic_dental_biometrics.

Switch to a Database:

sql

USE forensic_dental_biometrics;

This command selects the specified database, and any subsequent SQL commands you enter will be executed in the context of this database.

Perform Operations in the Database:
Once you've switched to the desired database, you can perform various operations, such as viewing tables, executing queries, or recording data.

For example, to see the tables in the current database:

sql

SHOW TABLES;

To record data into a table:

sql

    INSERT INTO your_table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

    Replace your_table_name, column1, column2, etc., and value1, value2, etc., with the actual table name, column names, and values you want to insert.

Remember to replace placeholders with your actual database, table, and user information. If you're unsure about the details, you can use the SHOW DATABASES; and SHOW TABLES; commands to explore the available databases and tables.

how to see data within table
ChatGPT

To see the data within a table in MariaDB using the command line, you can use the SELECT statement. Here's the basic syntax:

sql

SELECT * FROM your_table_name;

Replace your_table_name with the actual name of the table you want to query. If you want to see specific columns, you can replace * with the column names separated by commas.

Here's an example:

sql

SELECT column1, column2 FROM your_table_name;

To see all data in all columns of a table, use the asterisk *:

sql

SELECT * FROM your_table_name;

Here's a step-by-step guide:

    Open a terminal window.

    Access the MariaDB command-line interface:

    bash

mysql -u your_username -p

After entering your password, switch to the database containing the table:

sql

USE your_database_name;

View the data in the table:

sql

    SELECT * FROM your_table_name;
